          <p>This is a test website for JALU. It is a website where I will
          be testing my website creating skills, so the JALU website is like a DIY
        project, which might never be finished.</p>

        <div class="aboutPara">
          <p>The website is curently ment for personal use only even though
          it is public. Currently it is not meant for comercial use.</p> <br>
          <p>Home page currently features a webcam that only you can see and have acces to.</p>
          <p>The Bois page features a song and a video (NO COPYRIGHT INTENDED!) embeded in the website.
          Both were created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9p3149M3y7TiAFM0QvacOw">BluuBoiGreenMan</a>
        . Both the video and the song were made in good fun and
        mean no harm to any of the participants or the viewers. For adittional contact, contact the owner.</p>
        <p>The Call page is meant for 2 person conference calls.
        It has a website embeded in it, so it is a seprate website and is in this case
      used just for its content. The name of the website is <a href="https://www.zipcall.com/">ZipCall</a>.</p>
      <p>And you are currently on the about page.</p>
