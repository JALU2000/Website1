          <p>This is a test website for JALU. It is a website where I will
          be testing my website creating skills, so the JALU website is like a DIY
        project, which might never be finished.</p>

          <p>The Bois page features a song and a video (NO COPYRIGHT INTENDED!) embeded in the website.

        <p>The Call page is meant for 2 person conference calls.
        It has a website embeded in it, so it is a seprate website and is in this case
      used just for its content. The name of the website is <a href="https://www.zipcall.com/">ZipCall</a>.</p>
